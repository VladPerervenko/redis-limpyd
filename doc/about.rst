`redis-limpyd` is a project initiated by `Yohan Boniface <https://github.com/yohanboniface/>`_, using python to store "models" in Redis_.

The project can be found here: https://github.com/yohanboniface/redis-limyd

Yohan is helped in the developement by `St√©phane "Twidi" Angel <https://github.com/twidi/>`_, with lot of work on his branches, aimed to be integrated upstream via pull requests when we have time to review code.
You can found these branches here: https://github.com/twidi/redis-limpyd/branches (the `develop` branch is generally up to date with the work on all of them)

If you want to help, please fork (`master` or a feature branch, not `develop`) and work on a branch with a comprehensive name, write tests (seriously, everything is severely tested in `limpyd`) and make a pull request.
